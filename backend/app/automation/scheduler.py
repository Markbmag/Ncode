"""The scheduler: a background thread that runs due subscriptions.

Every `interval` seconds it looks for enabled subscriptions whose next run has come,
moves each one to its following run first (an atomic update, so two Ncode processes
on one database never send the same report twice) and runs it in a small pool.
Runs missed while the server was off are not repeated: a subscription that was due
runs once, then follows its schedule again.
